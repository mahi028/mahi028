## 🚀 About Me

I am a Data Science undergraduate at IIT Madras and currently in my fourth year. I have hands-on project in machine learning and created numerous projects spanning Computer vision, Natural language processing and various machine learning techniques. I have also managed to secured 8 CGPA in my third year and have certificates for demonstrating my skills in Deep learning with PyTorch and Machine learning techniques.\
I have an interest in developing project using Machine Learning and building robust pipelines with PyTorch, Hugging Face, Scikit-Learn etc. I'm Skilled in data cleaning, feature engineering, model ensemble, with expertise spanning 
various Neural Network architectures, machine learning techniques and multi-modal models.
